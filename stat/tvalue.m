% tvalue - T-value(s) between two samples
%                   
% [T] = tvalue(A,B)
% INPUTS:
% A - MxK matrix (M=number of observations in the 1st sample, K=number of measures)
% B - NxK matrix (N=number of observations in the 2nd sample, K=number of measures)
% OUTPUTS:
% T - 1xK vector of T-values
